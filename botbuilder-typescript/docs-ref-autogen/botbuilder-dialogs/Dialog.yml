    remarks: >-
      The bot is responsible for maintaining the sticky-ness of the dialog. To
      do that it should

      persist the state object it passed into the dialog as part of its overall
      state when the

      turn completes. When the user replies it then needs to pass the persisted
      state object into

      a call to the dialogs [continue()](#continue) method.


      Depending on the dialog, its possible for the dialog to finish immediately
      so it's advised

      to check the completion object returned by `begin()` and ensure that the
      dialog is still

      active before continuing.


      ```JavaScript

      const state = {};

      const completion = await dialog.begin(context, state);

      if (completion.isCompleted) {
          const value = completion.result;
      }

      ```

      The bot should keep calling `continue()` for future turns until the dialog
      returns a

      completion object with `isCompleted == true`. To cancel or interrupt the
      prompt simply

      delete the `state` object being persisted.


      ```JavaScript

      const completion = await dialog.continue(context, state);

      if (completion.isCompleted) {
          const value = completion.result;
