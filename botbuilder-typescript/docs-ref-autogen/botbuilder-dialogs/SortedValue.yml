summary: >-
  INTERNAL: A value that can be sorted and still refer to its original position
  within a source

  array. The `findChoices()` function expands the passed in choices to
  individual `SortedValue`

  instances and passes them to `findValues()`. Each individual `Choice` can
  result in multiple

  synonyms that should be searched for so this data structure lets us pass each
  synonym as a value

  to search while maintaining the index of the choice that value came from.
