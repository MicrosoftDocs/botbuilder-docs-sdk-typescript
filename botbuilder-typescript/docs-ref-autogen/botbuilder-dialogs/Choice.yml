### YamlMime:TSType
name: Choice
uid: botbuilder-dialogs.Choice
package: botbuilder-dialogs
summary: >-
  An instance of a choice that can be used to render a choice to a user or
  recognize something a

  user picked.
fullName: Choice
remarks: >-
  The [value](#value) will be rendered to a user unless an [action](#action) is
  provided in which

  case the actions `title` will be rendered to the user.


  At recognition time the `value` will always be what gets returned by
  `findChoices()` and

  `recognizeChoices()`. By default, the users utterance will be compared against
  all of the

  strings provided in the choice. You can disable using the `value` and/or
  `action.title` during

  recognition using the `FindChoicesOptions` structure.


  ```JavaScript

  const choice = {
      value: 'red',
      action: {
          type: 'imBack',
          title: 'The Red Pill',
          value: 'red pill'
      },
      synonyms: ['crimson', 'scarlet', 'ruby', 'cherry']
  };

  ```
