    summary: Memory based storage provider for a bot.
    package: botbuilder-core-extensions
    remarks: >-
      This provider is most useful for simulating production storage when
      running locally against the

      emulator or as part of a unit test. It has the following characteristics:


      - Starts off completely empty when the bot is run.

      - Anything written to the store will be forgotten when the process exits.

      - Object that are read and written to the store are cloned to properly
      simulate network based
        storage providers.
      - Cloned objects serialized using `JSON.stringify()` to catch any possible
      serialization related
        issues that might occur when using a network based storage provider.

      ```JavaScript

      const { MemoryStorage } = require('botbuilder');


      const storage = new MemoryStorage();

      ```
