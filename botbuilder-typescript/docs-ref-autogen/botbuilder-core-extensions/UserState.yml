    extends:

    package: botbuilder-core-extensions
    remarks: >-
      Each user your bot communicates with will have its own isolated storage
      object that can be used

      to persist information about the user across all of the conversation you
      have with that user.


      Since the `UserState` class derives from `BotState` it can be used as
      middleware to automatically

      read and write the bots user state for each turn. And it also means it can
      be passed to a

      `BotStateSet` middleware instance to be managed in parallel with other
      state providers.


      ```JavaScript

      const { UserState, MemoryStorage } = require('botbuilder');


      const userState = new UserState(new MemoryStorage());

      adapter.use(userState);


      server.post('/api/messages', (req, res) => {
         adapter.processActivity(req, res, async (context) => {
            // Get loaded user state
            const user = userState.get(context);

            // ... route activity ...

         });
      });
