    remarks: >-
      Each conversation your bot has with a user or group will have its own
      isolated storage object

      that can be used to persist conversation tracking information between
      turns of the conversation.

      This state information can be reset at any point by calling
      [clear()](#clear).


      Since the `ConversationState` class derives from `BotState` it can be used
      as middleware to

      automatically read and write the bots conversation state for each turn.
      And it also means it

      can be passed to a `BotStateSet` middleware instance to be managed in
      parallel with other state

      providers.


      ```JavaScript

      const { ConversationState, MemoryStorage } = require('botbuilder');


      const conversationState = new ConversationState(new MemoryStorage());

      adapter.use(conversationState);


      server.post('/api/messages', (req, res) => {
         adapter.processActivity(req, res, async (context) => {
            // Get loaded conversation state
            const convo = conversationState.get(context);

            // ... route activity ...

         });
      });

      ```
