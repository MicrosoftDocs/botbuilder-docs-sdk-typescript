      While the full set of dependencies is designed to be sufficient to run
      Adaptive Dialogs,

      the `"bot"` dependency can actually be any
      [ActivityHandler](xref:botbuilder-core.ActivityHandler)

      implementation and is not constrained to one that uses Adaptive Dialogs.
      Any Bot Framework project

      can therefore be simplified by just using this function along with a
      custom

      [ActivityHandler](xref:botbuilder-core.ActivityHandler) implementation.


      Aspects of the behavior of a number of these dependencies, including those
      that can be overriden,

      can be controlled through configuration.


      The default
      [ResourceExplorer](xref:botbuilder-dialogs-declarative.ResourceExplorer)
      uses the file

      system. The `applicationRoot` folder is used as the root directory.


      If not overridden, the exact type of
      [Storage](xref:botbuilder-core.Storage) added depends on configuration.

      With no configuration, the default is memory storage. It should be noted
      that

      [MemoryStorage](xref:botbuilder-core.MemoryStorage) is designed primarily
      for testing with a single host

      running the bot and no durable storage.


      The default Skills implementation can be constrained in terms of allowed
      callers through configuration.

      Refer to the product documentation for further details.


      The default [BotTelemetryClient](xref:botbuilder-core.BotTelemetryClient)
      implementation uses AppInsights

      and aspects of what is included in the telemetry data recorded can be
      controller through configuration.

      Refer to the product documentation for further details.


      A number of the features of the runtime are implemented through
      middleware. Various feature flags in

      configuration determine whether these middleware are added at runtime, the
      settings include:

      UseInspection, ShowTyping and SetSpeak.


      These control the addition of:

      [InspectionMiddleware](xref:botbuilder.InspectionMiddleware),

      [ShowTypingMiddleware](xref:botbuilder-core.ShowTypingMiddleware), and

      [SetSpeakMiddleware](xref:botbuilder.SetSpeakMiddleware) respectively.
