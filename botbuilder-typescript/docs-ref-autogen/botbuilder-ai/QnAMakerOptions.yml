      Defaults to a value of `false`.


      Setting this to `true` will cause the QnA Maker service to be called
      BEFORE any other

      middleware or the bots logic is run. Should the service return an answer
      the user will be

      automatically sent the answer and the turn completed such that no other
      middleware or the

      bots logic will be run.


      The default behavior is to only call the service AFTER all other
      middleware and the bots logic

      has run, and only under the condition that no other replies have been sent
      by the bot yet

      for this turn.
