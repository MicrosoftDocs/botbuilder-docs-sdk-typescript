summary: >-
  Middleware to patch mention Entities from Skype since they don't conform to
  expected values.

  Bots that interact with Skype should use this middleware if mentions are used.
fullName: SkypeMentionNormalizeMiddleware
remarks: >-
  A Skype mention "text" field is of the format:
    <at id="28:2bc5b54d-5d48-4ff1-bd25-03dcbb5ce918">botname</at>
  But Activity.Text doesn't contain those tags and RemoveMentionText can't
  remove

  the entity from Activity.Text.

  This will remove the <at> nodes, leaving just the name.
