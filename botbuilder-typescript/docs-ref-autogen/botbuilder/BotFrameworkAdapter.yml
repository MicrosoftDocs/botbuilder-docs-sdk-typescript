      A [BotAdapter](xref:botbuilder-core.BotAdapter) that can connect a bot to
      a service endpoint.

      Implements [IUserTokenProvider](xref:botbuilder-core.IUserTokenProvider).
    extends:
      name: BotAdapter
    package: botbuilder
    remarks: >-
      The bot adapter encapsulates authentication processes and sends activities
      to and receives

      activities from the Bot Connector Service. When your bot receives an
      activity, the adapter

      creates a turn context object, passes it to your bot application logic,
      and sends responses

      back to the user's channel.


      The adapter processes and directs incoming activities in through the bot
      middleware pipeline to

      your bot logic and then back out again. As each activity flows in and out
      of the bot, each

      piece of middleware can inspect or act upon the activity, both before and
      after the bot logic runs.

      Use the [use](xref:botbuilder-core.BotAdapter.use) method to add
      [Middleware](xref:botbuilder-core.Middleware)

      objects to your adapter's middleware collection.

    remarks: >-
      This is often referred to as a _proactive notification_, the bot can
      proactively

      send a message to a conversation or user without waiting for an incoming
      message.

      For example, a bot can use this method to send notifications or coupons to
      a user.


      To send a proactive message:

      1. Save a copy of a
      [ConversationReference](xref:botframework-schema.ConversationReference)
         from an incoming activity. For example, you can store the conversation reference in a database.
      1. Call this method to resume the conversation at a later time. Use the
      saved reference to access the conversation.

      1. On success, the adapter generates a
      [TurnContext](xref:botbuilder-core.TurnContext) object and calls the
      `logic` function handler.
         Use the `logic` function to send the proactive message.

      To copy the reference from any incoming activity in the conversation, use
      the

      [TurnContext.getConversationReference](xref:botbuilder-core.TurnContext.getConversationReference)
      method.


      This method is similar to the
      [processActivity](xref:botbuilder.BotFrameworkAdapter.processActivity)
      method.

      The adapter creates a [TurnContext](xref:botbuilder-core.TurnContext) and
      routes it through

      its middleware before calling the `logic` handler. The created activity
      will have a

      [type](xref:botframework-schema.Activity.type) of 'event' and a

      [name](xref:botframework-schema.Activity.name) of 'continueConversation'.


      For example:

      ```JavaScript

      server.post('/api/notifyUser', async (req, res) => {
         // Lookup previously saved conversation reference.
         const reference = await findReference(req.body.refId);

         // Proactively notify the user.
         if (reference) {
            await adapter.continueConversation(reference, async (context) => {
               await context.sendActivity(req.body.message);
            });
            res.send(200);
         } else {
            res.send(404);
         }
      });

    remarks: >-
      To use this method, you need both the bot's and the user's account
      information on a channel.

      The Bot Connector service supports the creating of group conversations;
      however, this

      method and most channels only support initiating a direct message
      (non-group) conversation.


      To create and start a new conversation:

      1. Get a copy of a
      [ConversationReference](xref:botframework-schema.ConversationReference)
      from an incoming activity.

      1. Set the [user](xref:botframework-schema.ConversationReference.user)
      property to the
         [ChannelAccount](xref:botframework-schema.ChannelAccount) value for the intended recipient.
      1. Call this method to request that the channel create a new conversation
      with the specified user.

      1. On success, the adapter generates a turn context and calls the `logic`
      function handler.


      To get the initial reference, use the

      [TurnContext.getConversationReference](xref:botbuilder-core.TurnContext.getConversationReference)

      method on any incoming activity in the conversation.


      If the channel establishes the conversation, the generated event
      activity's

      [conversation](xref:botframework-schema.Activity.conversation) property
      will contain the

      ID of the new conversation.


      This method is similar to the
      [processActivity](xref:botbuilder.BotFrameworkAdapter.processActivity)
      method.

      The adapter creates a [TurnContext](xref:botbuilder-core.TurnContext) and
      routes it through

      middleware before calling the `logic` handler. The created activity will
      have a

      [type](xref:botframework-schema.Activity.type) of 'event' and a

      [name](xref:botframework-schema.Activity.name) of 'createConversation'.


      For example:

      ```JavaScript

      // Get group members conversation reference

      const reference = TurnContext.getConversationReference(context.activity);


      // ...

      // Start a new conversation with the user

      await adapter.createConversation(reference, async (ctx) => {
         await ctx.sendActivity(`Hi (in private)`);
      });

      This is the main way a bot receives incoming messages and defines a turn
      in the conversation. This method:


      1. Parses and authenticates an incoming request.
         - The activity is read from the body of the incoming request. An error will be returned
           if the activity can't be parsed.
         - The identity of the sender is authenticated as either the Emulator or a valid Microsoft
           server, using the bot's `appId` and `appPassword`. The request is rejected if the sender's
           identity is not verified.
      1. Creates a [TurnContext](xref:botbuilder-core.TurnContext) object for
      the received activity.
         - This object is wrapped with a [revocable proxy](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-proxy.revocable).
         - When this method completes, the proxy is revoked.
      1. Sends the turn context through the adapter's middleware pipeline.

      1. Sends the turn context to the `logic` function.
         - The bot may perform additional routing or processing at this time.
           Returning a promise (or providing an `async` handler) will cause the adapter to wait for any asynchronous operations to complete.
         - After the `logic` function completes, the promise chain set up by the middleware is resolved.

      > [!TIP]

      > If you see the error `TypeError: Cannot perform 'set' on a proxy that
      has been revoked`

      > in your bot's console output, the likely cause is that an async function
      was used

      > without using the `await` keyword. Make sure all async functions use
      await!


      Middleware can _short circuit_ a turn. When this happens, subsequent
      middleware and the

      `logic` function is not called; however, all middleware prior to this
      point still run to completion.

      For more information about the middleware pipeline, see the

      [how bots
      work](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-basics) and

      [middleware](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-concept-middleware)
      articles.

      Use the adapter's [use](xref:botbuilder-core.BotAdapter.use) method to add
      middleware to the adapter.


      For example:

      ```JavaScript

      server.post('/api/messages', (req, res) => {
         // Route received request to adapter for processing
         adapter.processActivity(req, res, async (context) => {
             // Process any messages received
             if (context.activity.type === ActivityTypes.Message) {
                 await context.sendActivity(`Hello World`);
             }
         });
      });

      ```
