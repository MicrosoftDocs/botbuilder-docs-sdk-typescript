      The following steps will be taken to process the activity:


      - The identity of the sender will be verified to be either the Emulator or
      a valid Microsoft
        server. The bots `appId` and `appPassword` will be used during this process and the request
        will be rejected if the senders identity can't be verified.
      - The activity will be parsed from the body of the incoming request. An
      error will be returned
        if the activity can't be parsed.
      - A `TurnContext` instance will be created for the received activity and
      wrapped with a
        [Revocable Proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy/revocable).
      - The context will be routed through any middleware registered with the
      adapter using
        [use()](#use).  Middleware is executed in the order in which it's added and any middleware
        can intercept or prevent further routing of the context by simply not calling the passed
        in `next()` function. This is called the "Leading Edge" of the request and middleware will
        get a second chance to run on the "Trailing Edge" of the request after the bots logic has run.
      - Assuming the context hasn't been intercepted by a piece of middleware,
      the context will be
        passed to the logic handler passed in.  The bot may perform an additional routing or
        processing at this time. Returning a promise (or providing an `async` handler) will cause the
        adapter to wait for any asynchronous operations to complete.
      - Once the bots logic completes the promise chain setup by the middleware
      stack will be resolved
        giving middleware a second chance to run on the "Trailing Edge" of the request.
      - After the middleware stacks promise chain has been fully resolved the
      context object will be
        `revoked()` and any future calls to the context will result in a `TypeError: Cannot perform
        'set' on a proxy that has been revoked` being thrown.

      ```JavaScript

      server.post('/api/messages', (req, res) => {
         // Route received request to adapter for processing
         adapter.processActivity(req, res, async (context) => {
