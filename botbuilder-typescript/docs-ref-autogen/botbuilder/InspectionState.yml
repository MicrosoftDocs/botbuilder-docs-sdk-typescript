      The cleared state object will not be persisted until
      [saveChanges()](#savechanges) has

      been called.

    package: botbuilder
    summary: Delete the backing state object for the current turn.
    remarks: >-
      The state object will be removed from storage if it exists.  If the state
      object has been

      read in and cached, the cache will be cleared.

    uid: botbuilder.InspectionState.get
    package: botbuilder
    summary: Returns a cached state object or undefined if not cached.
    remarks: >-
      This example shows how to synchronously get an already loaded and cached
      state object:


      ```JavaScript

      const state = botState.get(context);

      ```
    isPreview: false
    isDeprecated: false
    syntax:
      content: 'function get(context: TurnContext): any | undefined'
      parameters:
        - id: context
          type: TurnContext
          description: Context for current turn of conversation with the user.
      return:
        description: A cached state object or undefined if not cached.
        type: any | undefined
    inheritanceDescription: <b>Inherited From</b> BotState.get
  - name: 'load(TurnContext, boolean)'
    uid: botbuilder.InspectionState.load
    package: botbuilder
    summary: Reads in and caches the backing state object for a turn.
    remarks: >-
      Subsequent reads will return the cached object unless the `force` flag is
      passed in which

      will force the state object to be re-read.


      This method is automatically called on first access of any of created
      property accessors.


      ```JavaScript

      const state = await botState.load(context);

      ```
    isPreview: false
    isDeprecated: false
    syntax:
      content: 'function load(context: TurnContext, force?: boolean): Promise<any>'
      parameters:
        - id: context
          type: TurnContext
          description: Context for current turn of conversation with the user.
        - id: force
          type: boolean
          description: >-
            (Optional) If `true` the cache will be bypassed and the state will
            always be read in directly from storage. Defaults to `false`.
      return:
        description: The cached state.
        type: Promise&lt;any&gt;
    inheritanceDescription: <b>Inherited From</b> BotState.load
  - name: 'saveChanges(TurnContext, boolean)'
    uid: botbuilder.InspectionState.saveChanges
    package: botbuilder
    summary: Saves the cached state object if it's been changed.
    remarks: >-
      If the `force` flag is passed in the cached state object will be saved
      regardless of

      whether its been changed or not and if no object has been cached, an empty
      object will be

      created and then saved.


      ```JavaScript

      await botState.saveChanges(context);

      ```
