summary: Reads and writes user state for your bot to storage.

remarks: >-
  Each user your bot communicates with will have its own isolated storage object
  that can be used

  to persist information about the user across all of the conversation you have
  with that user.

      The cleared state object will not be persisted until
      [saveChanges()](#savechanges) has

    remarks: >-
      The state object will be removed from storage if it exists.  If the state

      This example shows how to synchronously get an already loaded and cached

    summary: Reads in and caches the backing state object for a turn.
    remarks: >-
      Subsequent reads will return the cached object unless the `force` flag is
      passed in which

      will force the state object to be re-read.


      This method is automatically called on first access of any of created
      property accessors.

      whether its been changed or not and if no object has been cached, an empty

      created and then saved.
