summary: >
  If the activity name is signin/tokenExchange, this middleware will attempt to

  exchange the token, and deduplicate the incoming call, ensuring only one

  exchange request is processed.

  If a user is signed into multiple Teams clients, the Bot could receive a

  "signin/tokenExchange" from each client. Each token exchange request for a

  specific user login will have an identical activity.value.id.


  Only one of these token exchange requests should be processed by the bot.

  The others return
  [StatusCodes.PRECONDITION_FAILED](xref:botframework-schema:StatusCodes.PRECONDITION_FAILED).

  For a distributed bot in production, this requires distributed storage

  ensuring only one token exchange is processed. This middleware supports

  CosmosDb storage found in botbuilder-azure, or MemoryStorage for local
  development.
