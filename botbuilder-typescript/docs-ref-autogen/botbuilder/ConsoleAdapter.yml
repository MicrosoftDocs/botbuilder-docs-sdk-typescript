      The processing steps for this method are very similar to
      [listen()](#listen)

      in that a `TurnContext` will be created which is then routed through the
      adapters middleware

      before calling the passed in logic handler. The key difference being that
      since an activity

      wasn't actually received it has to be created.  The created activity will
      have its address

      related fields populated but will have a `context.activity.type ===
      undefined`.


      ```JavaScript

      function delayedNotify(context, message, delay) {
         const reference = TurnContext.getConversationReference(context.activity);
         setTimeout(() => {
            adapter.continueConversation(reference, async (ctx) => {
               await ctx.sendActivity(message);
            });
         }, delay);

      Upon receiving input from the console the flow is as follows:


      - An 'message' activity will be created containing the users input text.

      - A revokable `TurnContext` will be created for the activity.

      - The context will be routed through any middleware registered with
      [use()](#use).

      - The bots logic handler that was passed in will be executed.

      - The promise chain setup by the middleware stack will be resolved.

      - The context object will be revoked and any future calls to its members
      will result in a
        `TypeError` being thrown.

      ```JavaScript

      const closeFn = adapter.listen(async (context) => {
         const utterance = context.activity.text.toLowerCase();
