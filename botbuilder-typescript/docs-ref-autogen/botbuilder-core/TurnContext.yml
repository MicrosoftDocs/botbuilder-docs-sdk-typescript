      For TypeScript developers the `TurnContext` is also exposed as an
      interface which you can derive

      from to better describe the actual shape of the context object being
      passed around.  Middleware

      can potentially extend the context object with additional members so in
      order to get intellisense

      for those added members you'll need to define them on an interface that
      extends TurnContext:


      ```JavaScript

      interface MyContext extends TurnContext {
           // Added by UserState middleware.
           readonly userState: MyUserState;

           // Added by ConversationState middleware.
           readonly conversationState: MyConversationState;
      }


      adapter.processActivity(req, res, (context: MyContext) => {
           const state = context.conversationState;
      });

      ```

      bypasses any middleware which sometimes has its advantages.  The class to

      ensure that the

      outgoing activity is properly addressed:
