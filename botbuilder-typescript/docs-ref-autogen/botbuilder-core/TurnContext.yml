      context.turnState.set(cartKey, cart);

      ```

    remarks: >-
      Some channels, for example Microsoft Teams, add at mentions to the text of
      a message activity.


      Use this helper method to modify the activity's
      [text](xref:botframework-schema.Activity.text) property.

      It removes all at mentions for the given bot or user ID and then returns
      the updated property value.


      For example, when you remove mentions of **echoBot** from an activity
      containing the text "@echoBot Hi Bot",

      the activity text is updated, and the method returns "Hi Bot".


      The format of a mention [entity](xref:botframework-schema.Entity) is
      channel-dependent.

      However, the mention's [text](xref:botframework-schema.Mention.text)
      property should contain

      the exact text for the user as it appears in the activity text.


      For example, whether the channel uses "<at>username</at>" or "@username",
      this string is in

      the activity's text, and this method will remove all occurrences of that
      string from the text.


      For example:

      ```JavaScript

      const updatedText = TurnContext.removeMentionText(activity,
      activity.recipient.id);

      rate, volume, pronunciation,

      and pitch, specify **speak** in Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML)

      For example:

      ```JavaScript

      await context.sendActivity(`Hello World`);

      ```
