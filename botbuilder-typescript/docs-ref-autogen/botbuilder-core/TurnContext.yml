      a message activity.


      Use this helper method to modify the activity's
      [text](xref:botframework-schema.Activity.text) property.

      It removes all at mentions for the given bot or user ID and then returns
      the updated property value.


      For example, when you remove mentions of **echoBot** from an activity
      containing the text "@echoBot Hi Bot",

      the activity text is updated, and the method returns "Hi Bot".


      The format of a mention [entity](xref:botframework-schema.Entity) is
      channel-dependent.

      However, the mention's [text](xref:botframework-schema.Mention.text)
      property should contain

      the exact text for the user as it appears in the activity text.


      For example, whether the channel uses "<at>username</at>" or "@username",
      this string is in

      the activity's text, and this method will remove all occurrences of that
      string from the text.


      For example:

      ```JavaScript

      const updatedText = TurnContext.removeMentionText(activity,
      activity.recipient.id);

      Creates and sends a Trace activity. Trace activities are only sent when
      the channel is the emulator.


      For example:

      ```JavaScript

      await context.sendTraceActivity(`The following exception was thrown
      ${msg}`);

      Middleware, other components, and services will typically use this to

      that could be asked for by a bot multiple times during a turn. You can use
      this cache to

      pass information between components of your bot.


      For example:

      ```JavaScript

      const cartKey = Symbol();

      const cart = await loadUsersShoppingCart(context);

      context.turnState.set(cartKey, cart);

      ```


      > [!TIP]

      > When creating middleware or a third-party component, use a unique symbol
      for your cache key

      > to avoid state naming collisions with the bot or other middleware or
      components.
