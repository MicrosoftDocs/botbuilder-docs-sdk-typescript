summary: Reads and writes user state for your bot to storage.

remarks: >-
  Each user your bot communicates with will have its own isolated storage object
  that can be used

  to persist information about the user across all of the conversation you have
  with that user.

  const { UserState, MemoryStorage } = require('botbuilder');


  const userState = new UserState(new MemoryStorage());

      The cleared state object will not be persisted until
      [saveChanges()](#savechanges) has

      The state object will be removed from storage if it exists.  If the state
      object has been

      read in and cached, the cache will be cleared.

      This example shows how to synchronously get an already loaded and cached
      state object:

    summary: Reads in and caches the backing state object for a turn.
    remarks: >-
      Subsequent reads will return the cached object unless the `force` flag is
      passed in which

      will force the state object to be re-read.


      This method is automatically called on first access of any of created
      property accessors.

    remarks: >-
      If the `force` flag is passed in the cached state object will be saved
      regardless of

      whether its been changed or not and if no object has been cached, an empty
      object will be

      created and then saved.
