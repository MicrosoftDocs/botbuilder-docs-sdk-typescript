summary: Middleware that will send a typing indicator automatically for each message.
fullName: ShowTypingMiddleware
remarks: >-
  When added, this middleware will send typing activities back to the user when
  a Message activity

  is received to let them know that the bot has received the message and is
  working on the response.

  You can specify a delay in milliseconds before the first typing activity is
  sent and then a frequency,

  also in milliseconds which determines how often another typing activity is
  sent. Typing activities

  will continue to be sent until your bot sends another message back to the user
