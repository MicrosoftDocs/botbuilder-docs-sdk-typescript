      Defines the core behavior of a bot adapter that can connect a bot to a
      service endpoint.
    package: botbuilder-core - v4
    remarks: >-
      The bot adapter encapsulates authentication processes and sends activities
      to and receives

      activities from the Bot Connector Service. When your bot receives an
      activity, the adapter

      creates a turn context object, passes it to your bot application logic,
      and sends responses

      back to the user's channel.


      The adapter processes and directs incoming activities in through the bot
      middleware pipeline to

      your bot logic and then back out again. As each activity flows in and out
      of the bot, each

      piece of middleware can inspect or act upon the activity, both before and
      after the bot logic runs.

      Use the [use](xref:botbuilder-core.BotAdapter.use) method to add
      [Middleware](xref:botbuilder-core.Middleware)

      objects to your adapter's middleware collection.
