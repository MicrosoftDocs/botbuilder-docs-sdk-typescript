  All of these functions return an
  [Attachment](xref:botframework-schema.Attachment) object,

  which can be added to an existing activity's
  [attachments](xref:botframework-schema.Activity.attachments) collection
  directly or

  passed as input to one of the
  [MessageFactory](xref:botbuilder-core.MessageFactory) methods to generate a
  new activity.


  This example sends a message that contains a single hero card.


  ```javascript

  const { MessageFactory, CardFactory } = require('botbuilder');


  const card = CardFactory.heroCard(
       'White T-Shirt',
       ['https://example.com/whiteShirt.jpg'],
       ['buy']
  );

  const message = MessageFactory.attachment(card);

  await context.sendActivity(message);

    remarks: >-
      Adaptive Cards are an open card exchange format enabling developers to
      exchange UI content in a common and consistent way.

      For channels that don't yet support Adaptive Cards natively, the Bot
      Framework will

      down-render the card to an image that's been styled to look good on the
      target channel. For

      channels that support [hero cards](#herocards) you can continue to include
      Adaptive Card

      actions and they will be sent as buttons along with the rendered version
      of the card.


      For more information about Adaptive Cards and to download the latest SDK,
      visit

      [adaptivecards.io](http://adaptivecards.io/).


      For example:
