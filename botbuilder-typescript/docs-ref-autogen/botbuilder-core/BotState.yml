### YamlMime:TSType
name: BotState
uid: botbuilder-core.BotState
package: botbuilder-core
summary: Base class for the frameworks state persistance scopes.
fullName: BotState
remarks: >-
  This class will read and write state, to a provided storage provider, for each
  turn of

  conversation with a user. Derived classes, like `ConversationState` and
  `UserState`, provide a

  `StorageKeyFactory` which is used to determine the key used to persist a given
  storage object.


  The state object thats loaded will be automatically cached on the context
  object for the

  lifetime of the turn and will only be written to storage if it has been
  modified.

    summary: Clears the current state object for a turn.
    remarks: >-
      The cleared state object will not be persisted until
      [saveChanges()](#savechanges) has

      been called.

  - name: delete(TurnContext)
    uid: botbuilder-core.BotState.delete
    package: botbuilder-core
    summary: Delete the backing state object for the current turn.
    remarks: >-
      The state object will be removed from storage if it exists.  If the state
      object has been

      read in and cached, the cache will be cleared.


      ```JavaScript

      await botState.delete(context);

      ```
    isPreview: false
    isDeprecated: false
    syntax:

  - name: get(TurnContext)
    uid: botbuilder-core.BotState.get
    package: botbuilder-core
    summary: Returns a cached state object or undefined if not cached.
    remarks: >-
      This example shows how to synchronously get an already loaded and cached
      state object:


      ```JavaScript

      const state = botState.get(context);

      ```
    isPreview: false
    isDeprecated: false
    syntax:
      content: 'function get(context: TurnContext): any | undefined'
      parameters:
        - id: context
          type: <xref uid="botbuilder-core.TurnContext" />
          description: Context for current turn of conversation with the user.
      return:
        description: A cached state object or undefined if not cached.
        type: any | undefined
  - name: 'load(TurnContext, boolean)'
    uid: botbuilder-core.BotState.load
    package: botbuilder-core
    summary: Reads in and caches the backing state object for a turn.
    remarks: >-
      Subsequent reads will return the cached object unless the `force` flag is
      passed in which

      will force the state object to be re-read.


      This method is automatically called on first access of any of created
      property accessors.


      ```JavaScript

      const state = await botState.load(context);

      ```
    isPreview: false
    isDeprecated: false
    syntax:
      content: 'function load(context: TurnContext, force?: boolean): Promise<any>'

        - id: context
          type: <xref uid="botbuilder-core.TurnContext" />
          description: Context for current turn of conversation with the user.
        - id: force
          type: boolean
          description: >-
            (Optional) If `true` the cache will be bypassed and the state will
            always be read in directly from storage. Defaults to `false`.
      return:
        description: The cached state.
        type: Promise&lt;any&gt;
  - name: 'saveChanges(TurnContext, boolean)'
    uid: botbuilder-core.BotState.saveChanges
    package: botbuilder-core
    summary: Saves the cached state object if it's been changed.
    remarks: >-
      If the `force` flag is passed in the cached state object will be saved
      regardless of

      whether its been changed or not and if no object has been cached, an empty
      object will be

      created and then saved.


      ```JavaScript

      await botState.saveChanges(context);

      ```
    isPreview: false
    isDeprecated: false
