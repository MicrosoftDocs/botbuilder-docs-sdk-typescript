    remarks: >-
      This class will read and write state, to a provided storage provider, for
      each turn of

      conversation with a user. Derived classes, like `ConversationState` and
      `UserState`, provide a

      `StorageKeyFactory` which is used to determine the key used to persist a
      given storage object.


      The state object thats loaded will be automatically cached on the context
      object for the

      lifetime of the turn and will only be written to storage if it has been
      modified.

      This example shows how to synchronously get an already loaded and cached

    remarks: >-
      Subsequent reads will return the cached object unless the `force` flag is
      passed in which

      will force the state object to be re-read.


      This method is automatically called on first access of any of created
      property accessors.

    remarks: >-
      If the `force` flag is passed in the cached state object will be saved
      regardless of

      whether its been changed or not and if no object has been cached, an empty
      object will be

      created and then saved.


      ```JavaScript

      await botState.saveChanges(context);
