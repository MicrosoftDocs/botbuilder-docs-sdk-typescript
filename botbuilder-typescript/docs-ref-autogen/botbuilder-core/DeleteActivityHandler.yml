      **Parameters**


      | Name | Type | Description |

      | :--- | :--- | :--- |

      | `context` | [TurnContext](xref:botbuilder-core.TurnContext) | The
      context object for the turn. |

      | `reference` |
      Partial\<[ConversationReference](xref:botframework-schema.ConversationReference)>
      | The conversation containing the activity to delete. |

      | `next` | () => Promise\<void> | The function to call to continue event
      processing. |


      A handler calls the `next` function to pass control to the next registered
      handler.

      If a handler doesnâ€™t call the `next` function, the adapter does not call
      any of the

      subsequent handlers and does not attempt to delete the activity.


      The `reference` parameter's
      [activityId](xref:botframework-schema.ConversationReference.activityId)
      property indicates which activity

      in the conversation to delete.
