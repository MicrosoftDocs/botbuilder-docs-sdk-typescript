  **Parameters**


  | Name | Type | Description |

  | :--- | :--- | :--- |

  | `context` | [TurnContext](xref:botbuilder-core.TurnContext) | The context
  object for the turn. |

  | `reference` |
  Partial\<[ConversationReference](xref:botframework-schema.ConversationReference)>
  | The conversation containing the activity to delete. |

  | `next` | () => Promise\<void> | The function to call to continue event
  processing. |


  A handler calls the `next` function to pass control to the next registered
  handler.

  If a handler doesn’t call the `next` function, the adapter does not call any
  of the

  subsequent handlers and does not attempt to delete the activity.


  The `reference` parameter's
  [activityId](xref:botframework-schema.ConversationReference.activityId)
  property indicates which activity

  in the conversation to delete.
