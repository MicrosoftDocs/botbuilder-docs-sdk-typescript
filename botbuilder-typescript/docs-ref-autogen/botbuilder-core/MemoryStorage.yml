uid: botbuilder-core.MemoryStorage
package: botbuilder-core
summary: Memory based storage provider for a bot.
fullName: MemoryStorage
remarks: >-
  This provider is most useful for simulating production storage when running
  locally against the

  emulator or as part of a unit test. It has the following characteristics:


  - Starts off completely empty when the bot is run.

  - Anything written to the store will be forgotten when the process exits.

  - Objects that are read and written to the store are cloned to properly
  simulate network based
    storage providers.
  - Cloned objects are serialized using `JSON.stringify()` to catch any possible
  serialization
    related issues that might occur when using a network based storage provider.

  ```JavaScript

  const { MemoryStorage } = require('botbuilder');


  const storage = new MemoryStorage();
