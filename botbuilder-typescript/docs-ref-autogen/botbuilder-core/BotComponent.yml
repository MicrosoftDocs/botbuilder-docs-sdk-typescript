summary: >
  Definition of a BotComponent that allows registration of services, custom
  actions, memory scopes and adapters.

  To make your components available to the system you derive from BotComponent
  and register services to add functionality.

  These components then are consumed in appropriate places by the systems that
  need them. When using Composer, configureServices

  gets called automatically on the components by the bot runtime, as long as the
  components are registered in the configuration.
