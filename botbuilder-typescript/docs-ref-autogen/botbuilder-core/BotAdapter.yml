uid: botbuilder-core.BotAdapter
package: botbuilder-core
summary: >-
  Defines the core behavior of a bot adapter that can connect a bot to a service
  endpoint.
fullName: BotAdapter
remarks: >-
  The bot adapter encapsulates authentication processes and sends activities to
  and receives

  activities from the Bot Connector Service. When your bot receives an activity,
  the adapter

  creates a turn context object, passes it to your bot application logic, and
  sends responses

  back to the user's channel.


  The adapter processes and directs incoming activities in through the bot
  middleware pipeline to

  your bot logic and then back out again. As each activity flows in and out of
  the bot, each

  piece of middleware can inspect or act upon the activity, both before and
  after the bot logic runs.

  Use the [use](xref:botbuilder-core.BotAdapter.use) method to add
  [Middleware](xref:botbuilder-core.Middleware)

  objects to your adapter's middleware collection.

  work](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-basics) and
