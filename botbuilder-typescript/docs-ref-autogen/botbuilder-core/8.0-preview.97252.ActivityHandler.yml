      This provides an extensible class for handling incoming activities in an
      event-driven way.

      You can register an arbitrary set of handlers for each event type.


      To register a handler for an event, use the corresponding _on event_
      method. If multiple handlers are

      registered for an event, they are run in the order in which they were
      registered.


      This object emits a series of _events_ as it processes an incoming
      activity.

      A handler can stop the propagation of the event by not calling the
      continuation function.


      | Event type | Description |

      | :--- | :--- |

      | Turn | Emitted first for every activity. |

      | Type-specific | Emitted for the specific activity type, before emitting
      an event for any sub-type. |

      | Sub-type | Emitted for certain specialized events, based on activity
      content. |

      | Dialog | Emitted as the final activity processing event. Designed for
      passing control to a dialog. |


      For example:


      ```typescript

      const bot = new ActivityHandler();


      server.post('/api/messages', (req, res) => {
          adapter.processActivity(req, res, async (context) => {
              // Route to main dialog.
              await bot.run(context);
          });
      });


      bot.onTurn(async (context, next) => {
              // Handle a "turn" event.
              await context.sendActivity(`${ context.activity.type } activity received.`);
              // Continue with further processing.
              await next();
          })
          .onMessage(async (context, next) => {
              // Handle a message activity.
              await context.sendActivity(`Echo: ${ context.activity.text }`);
              // Continue with further processing.
              await next();
          });
      ```

      Event activities communicate programmatic information from a client or
      channel to a bot.

      The meaning of an event activity is defined by the activity's

      [name](xref:botframework-schema.Activity.name) property, which is
      meaningful within the scope

      of a channel. Event activities are designed to carry both interactive
      information (such as

      button clicks) and non-interactive information (such as a notification of
      a client

      automatically updating an embedded speech model).


      To handle a `tokens/response` event event, use the

      [onTokenResponseEvent](xref:botbuilder-core.ActivityHandler.onTokenResponseEvent)
      sub-type

      event handler. To handle other named events, add logic to this handler.

      Message reaction activities represent a social interaction on an existing

      within a conversation. The original activity is referred to by the message
      reaction activity's
