    remarks: >-
      Calling `await next();` will cause execution to continue to either the
      next piece of

      middleware in the chain or the bots main logic if you are the last piece
      of middleware.


      Your middleware should perform its business logic before and/or after the
      call to `next()`.

      You can short-circuit further execution of the turn by omitting the call
      to `next()`.


      The following example shows a simple piece of logging middleware:


      ```JavaScript

      class MyLogger {
          async onTurn(context, next) {
              console.log(`Leading Edge`);
              await next();
              console.log(`Trailing Edge`);
          }
      }

      ```
