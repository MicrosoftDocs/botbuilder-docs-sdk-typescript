      **Parameters**


      | Name | Type | Description |

      | :--- | :--- | :--- |

      | `context` | [TurnContext](xref:botbuilder-core.TurnContext) | The
      context object for the turn. |

      | `activities` | Partial\<[Activity](xref:botframework-schema.Activity)>[]
      | The activities to send. |

      | `next` | () =>
      Promise\<[ResourceResponse](xref:botframework-schema.ResourceResponse)[]>
      | The function to call to continue event processing. |


      **Returns**


      Promise\<[ResourceResponse](xref:botframework-schema.ResourceResponse)[]>


      A handler calls the `next` function to pass control to the next registered
      handler. If a handler

      doesn't call the `next` function, the adapter does not call any of the
      subsequent handlers and

      does not send the activities to the user.


      If the activities are successfully sent, the `next` function returns an
      array of

      [ResourceResponse](xref:botframework-schema.ResourceResponse) objects
      containing the IDs that the

      receiving channel assigned to the activities. Use this array as the return
      value of this handler.
