      Signature for functions passed as steps to
      [DialogAction.waterfall()](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/classes/_botbuilder_d_.dialogaction.html#waterfall).

      Waterfalls let you prompt a user for information using a sequence of
      questions. Each step of the

      waterfall can either execute one of the built-in
      [Prompts](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/interfaces/_botbuilder_d_.__global.iprompts.html),

      start a new dialog by calling
      [session.beginDialog()](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/classes/_botbuilder_d_.session.html#begindialog),

      advance to the next step of the waterfall manually using `skip()`, or
      terminate the waterfall.


      When either a dialog or built-in prompt is called from a waterfall step,
      the results from that

      dialog or prompt will be passed via the `results` parameter to the next
      step of the waterfall.

      Users can say things like "never mind" to cancel the built-in prompts so
      you should guard against

      that by at least checking for
      [results.response](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/interfaces/_botbuilder_d_.idialogresult.html#response)

      before proceeding. A more detailed explanation of why the waterfall is
      being continued can be

      determined by looking at the
      [code](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/enums/_botbuilder_d_.resumereason.html)

      returned for
      [results.resumed](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/interfaces/_botbuilder_d_.idialogresult.html#resumed).


      You can manually advance to the next step of the waterfall using the
      `skip()` function passed

      in. Calling `skip({ response: "some text" })` with an
      [IDialogResult](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/interfaces/_botbuilder_d_.idialogresult.html)

      lets you more accurately mimic the results from a built-in prompt and can
      simplify your overall

      waterfall logic.


      You can terminate a waterfall early by either falling through every step
      of the waterfall using

      calls to `skip()` or simply not starting another prompt or dialog.


      __note:__ Waterfalls have a hidden last step which will automatically end
      the current dialog if

      if you call a prompt or dialog from the last step. This is useful where
      you have a deep stack of

      dialogs and want a call to
      [session.endDialog()](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/classes/_botbuilder_d_.session.html#enddialog)

      from the last child on the stack to end the entire stack. The close of the
      last child will trigger

      all of its parents to move to this hidden step which will cascade the
      close all the way up the stack.

      This is typically a desired behavior but if you want to avoid it or stop
      it somewhere in the

      middle you'll need to add a step to the end of your waterfall that either
      does nothing or calls

      something like
      [session.send()](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/classes/_botbuilder_d_.session.html#send)

      which isn't going to advance the waterfall forward.
