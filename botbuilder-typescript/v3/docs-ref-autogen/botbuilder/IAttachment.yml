  Many messaging channels provide the ability to attach richer objects. Bot
  Builder lets you express these attachments in a cross channel way and
  [connectors](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/interfaces/_botbuilder_d_.iconnector.html)
  will do their best to render the

  attachments using the channels native constructs. If you desire more control
  over the channels rendering of a message you can use
  [IEvent.sourceEvent](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/interfaces/_botbuilder_d_.ievent.html#sourceevent)
  to provide attachments using

  the channels native schema. The types of attachments that can be sent varies
  by channel but these are the basic types:

  * __Media and Files:__  Basic files can be sent by setting
  [contentType](#contenttype) to the MIME type of the file and then passing a
  link to the file in [contentUrl](#contenturl).

  * __Cards:__  A rich set of visual cards can by setting
  [contentType](#contenttype) to the cards type and then passing the JSON for
  the card in [content](#content). If you use one of the rich card builder
  classes like

  [HeroCard](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/classes/_botbuilder_d_.herocard.html)
  the attachment will automatically filled in for you.
