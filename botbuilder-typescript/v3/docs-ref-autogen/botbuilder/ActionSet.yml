package: botbuilder
summary: >-
  Implement support for named actions which can be bound to a dialog to handle
  global utterances from the user like "help" or

  "cancel". Actions get pushed onto and off of the dialog stack as part of
  dialogs so these listeners can

  come into and out of scope as the conversation progresses. You can also bind
  named to actions to buttons

  which let your bot respond to button clicks on cards that have maybe scrolled
  off the screen.

    summary: >-
      Called once for each dialog within a library to give the dialog a chance
      to add its

      `triggerAction()` to the libraries global action set.  These triggers get
      mapped to

      a `beginDialogAction()` that starts the dialog when the trigger condition
      is met.
