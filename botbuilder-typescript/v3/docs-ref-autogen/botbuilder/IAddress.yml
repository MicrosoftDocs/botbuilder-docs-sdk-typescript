name: IAddress
uid: botbuilder.IAddress
package: botbuilder
summary: >
  Address routing information for an
  [event](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/interfaces/_botbuilder_d_.ievent.html#address).

  Addresses are bidirectional meaning they can be used to address both incoming
  and outgoing events.

  They're also connector specific meaning that
  [connectors](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/interfaces/_botbuilder_d_.iconnector.html)

  are free to add their own fields to the address.

  To send a __proactive message__ to a user bots should save the address from a
  received
  [message](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/interfaces/_botbuilder_d_.imessage).

  Depending on the channel addresses can change, so bots should periodically
  update the address stored for a given

  user.
