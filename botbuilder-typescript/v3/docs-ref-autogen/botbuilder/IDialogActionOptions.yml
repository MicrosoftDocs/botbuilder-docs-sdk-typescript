      (Optional) intent(s) used to trigger the action. Either a regular
      expression or a named

      intent can be provided and multiple intents can be specified.  When a
      named intent is

      provided the action will be matched using the recognizers assigned to the
      library/bot using

      [Library.recognizer()](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/classes/_botbuilder_d_.library#recognizer).

      If a matches option isn't provided then the action can only be matched if
      an [onFindAction](#onfindaction)

      handler is provided.

      checked to see if it

      should be triggered. The handler is passed a context object containing the
      received message

      and any intents detected. The handler should return a confidence score for
      0.0 to 1.0 and

      routeData that should be passed in during the `selectActionRoute` call.

      (Optional) custom handler that's invoked whenever the action is
      triggered.  This lets you

      customize the behavior of an action. For instance you could clear the
      dialog stack before

      the new dialog is started, changing the default behavior which is to just
      push the new

      dialog onto the end of the stack.

      It's important to note that this is not a waterfall and you should call
      `next()` if you

      would like the actions default behavior to run.
