      recognition.

      actions bound to the dialog that better matches the users utterance.

      at the bot level will also be evaluated. If the dialog has a score higher
      then any bound actions,

      the dialogs [replyReceived()](#replyreceived) method will be called with

      returned from the recognize() call.  This lets the dialog pass additional
      data collected during

      the recognize phase to the replyReceived() method for handling.
